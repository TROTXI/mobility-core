# Platform status & gap analysis

**Snapshot:** 2026-06-26 · a point-in-time map of `mobility-core`. Update as
areas land; it is not authoritative once the code moves.

## Architecture (what exists)

`services/api` — Fastify 5 + TypeScript (Node 24), single process, layered
`server.ts → buildApp (app.ts) → plugins/routes → repositories`.

| Layer        | Modules                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Config       | `config/env.ts` (zod-validated env), `config/dotenv.ts`                                                                                                                                                  |
| Data         | `db/migrate.ts` (runner), `db/pool.ts`; migrations `001_init` (users, auth_identity, sessions), `002`/`003` (subscriptions + constraints), `014` (mobility routes/stops), `015` (trips/vehicles/drivers) |
| KV           | `kv/kv.store.ts` (interface + in-memory), `kv.store.redis.ts` (ADR-0010)                                                                                                                                 |
| Auth         | `auth/jwt.ts`, `auth/auth.plugin.ts` (`authenticate`/`requireRole`), `auth/auth.routes.ts` (`/me`) (ADR-0007)                                                                                            |
| Rate limit   | `ratelimit/ratelimit.plugin.ts` (#23)                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Domain repos | `users/*`, `subscriptions/*` — **repos only, no routes**; `mobility/*` — repos + browse routes (#17)                                                                                                     |
| Contract     | `lib/schemas.ts`, `user.schema.ts`, `mobility.schema.ts`, OpenAPI via zod type-provider (ADR-0008)                                                                                                       |

**Live HTTP surface:** `/`, `/version`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/me`, `/docs`, `/routes`, `/routes/:id`, `/trips`, `/trips/:id`, `/flags` (public feature flags + min supported version, #27), `/admin/*` (fleet CRUD + trip assignment + flags/min-versions, admin-only, #26/#27).

**Cross-cutting (in place):** repository pattern (ADR-0009), KV fallback
(ADR-0010), readiness pings DB+KV, rate limiting, typed OpenAPI, ~100% unit
coverage, CI + security gates (gitleaks/CodeQL/audit), CD (migrate→deploy,
staging auto / prod gated), CODEOWNERS + code-owner reviews.

## Gaps

### 🔴 Auth is half-built (highest impact)

- **No sign-in** — no `/auth/google` / `/auth/apple`, no ID-token verification
  (slice 2). Blocks the mobile login flow (#34).
- **`sessions` and `auth_identity` tables exist but are unused** — no refresh
  tokens, rotation, revoke, or logout. The refresh half of ADR-0007 is unbuilt.

### 🟡 Subscriptions

- Data layer only — **no endpoint** (e.g. `GET /me/subscription`); not usable
  over HTTP. `plan` is free-text (no enum/CHECK). In-memory repo does not enforce
  one-active-per-user (the DB does — see ADR-0009).

### 🟡 Mobility — browse layer only (closes #17, PR #57)

Data model and read endpoints are in place; trips landed (#18), so the
operational layer now has schedules — boarding and live positions are next.

**What landed (migration `004_mobility_routes.sql`):**

- `routes` table — name, description, timestamps.
- `stops` table — name, `location geography(Point, 4326)`, GiST index. Stored as
  PostGIS geography so spatial queries (nearest stop, corridor search) can run
  without a second datastore (ADR-0005). The domain model exposes plain `lat`/`lng`
  numbers; `ST_MakePoint`/`ST_X`/`ST_Y` handle the conversion at the Pg adapter
  boundary only.
- `route_stops` join table — `(route_id, stop_id, seq)`. `seq` is a per-route
  integer that defines boarding order. `UNIQUE (route_id, seq)` prevents duplicate
  positions at the DB level; the in-memory adapter does not enforce this (ADR-0009).

**Design choices:**

- **Browse endpoints are intentionally public** (`GET /routes`, `GET /routes/:id`).
  The mobile app must display the route map before a user signs in — requiring auth
  here would block the discovery flow.
- **Stop resolution is a fan-out, not a JOIN.** `GET /routes/:id` fetches ordered
  `route_stops`, then resolves each stop via `Promise.all`. This keeps the domain
  model decoupled from the DB schema. At browse-only scale the N+1 is negligible;
  if it becomes a hotspot, a single query returning a JSON array can replace the
  fan-out without changing the API contract.
- **Follows ADR-0009 exactly** — `InMemory*` repos for unit tests / zero-infra dev;
  `Pg*` adapters for real runs; `server.ts` selects by `DATABASE_URL`.

**Still missing (mobility):**

### 🟡 Architecture notes

- **No service layer** yet — routes call repositories directly. Fine at this size;
  introduce `routes → services → repositories` before real business logic lands.
- e2e is minimal — no DB-backed flows (ci.yml has a TODO for a postgis service
  container + seed).

## ADR status

- **0003** (TS+Fastify) — amended for Node 24 (was 22).
- **0007** (JWT) — accurate; rate limiting it cited as "slice 3" has since landed (#23).
- **0009** (repository pattern), **0010** (KV/Redis) — added to record patterns
  that were previously only in code comments.

## Suggested next

1. **Auth slice 2** (sign-in + refresh) — the biggest unblock; needs Google OAuth
   setup.
2. `GET /me/subscription` — make subscriptions a real, secured, documented API.
3. **Trips & schedules** (#18) — next mobility slice; builds on the routes/stops
   foundation from PR #57.
4. Observability (#28) — `/metrics` + structured fields, before traffic grows.
